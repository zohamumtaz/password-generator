In this Code we are making a password generator.

(Steps)

First we created an HTML file and CSS file to see what the password generator looks like.
We created JS file to work on the behaviour of the password generator.
Next we ask the user to enter the length of the password.
Then we check the length with the help of three conditions.

 (Conditions)

1. first condition that the user enters the data in numeric.
 if not than alert the user that write the length of the password in numeric form.

2.
Then checking if the length is > 7 if its not >7 than we alert the user length must be atleast 8.

3.
Length must not exceed more than 128.
if not then we alert the user number must be >129.



After these conditions we ask the user do you want to include speacial,numeric,upper and lower case charecters.

If all of these are not included in the input by the user then we alert the user that it must select atlast one.

Lastly after this we generate a random password based on the input of the user,
In the end the password will be generated and displayed on the user screen.
